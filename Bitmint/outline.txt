=== Coin security layers ===
[0] (Asymmetric Signing) To validate that the coins were once minted
// [-] (Asymetric Encryption) To show ownership of the coin

=== Coin Idea #1 ===
- There has to be hash or somthing that is encrypted by someone's private and public keys
- The coins must become invalid once used
- There has to be something to validate the hash
- I need to prevent stealing of the coins
- The coin must also have a sort of private key that is held
- The coin could have some sort of cryptographic history to prevent the taking and regifting of the coins
- A payment transaction must have some sort of cryptographic proof
- A payment must have a encrypted trascript that cannot be tampered with

=== Coin Idea #2 ===
- Expensive to transfer coin's ownership
- You need to guess a salt for a hash that encrypts the signature
- The coins must become invalid once used
